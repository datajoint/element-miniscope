# Concepts

## Miniscopes in Neuroscience Research

Miniature fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) are a head-mounted calcium imaging
full-frame video modality first introduced in 2005 by Mark Schnitzer's lab[^1]. Due to
their light weight, these miniscopes allow measuring the dynamic activity of populations
of cortical neurons in freely behaving animals. In 2011, Inscopix Inc. was founded to
support one-photon miniscopes as a commercial neuroscience research platform, providing
proprietary hardware, acquisition software, and analysis software. Today, they estimate
their active user base is 491 labs with a total of 1179 installs.

An open-source alternative was launched by a UCLA team led by Drs. Daniel Aharoni and
Peyman Golshani[^2][^3]. In our conversation with Dr. Aharoni, he estimated about 700
labs currently using the UCLA system alone. The Inscopix user base is smaller but more
established. Several two-photon miniscopes have been developed but lack widespread
adoption likely due to the expensive hardware required for the two-photon
excitation[^3][^4][^5]. Due to the low costs and ability to record during natural
behaviors, one-photon miniscope imaging appears to be the fastest growing calcium
imaging modality in the field today.

The DataJoint team focused efforts on supporting the UCLA platform due rapid growth and
limited standardization in acquisition and processing pipelines. In the future, we will
reach out to Inscopix to support their platform as well.

### Acquisition Tools

Dr. Daniel Aharoni's lab has developed iterations of the UCLA Miniscope platform. Based
on interviews, we have found labs using the two most recent versions including
[Miniscope DAQ V3](http://miniscope.org/index.php/Information_on_the_(previous_Version_3)_Miniscope_platform)
and [Miniscope DAQ V4](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki). Labs also use
the Bonsai OpenEphys tool for data acquisition with the UCLA miniscope. Inscopix
provides the Inscopix Data Acquisition Software (IDAS) for the nVista and nVoke systems.

### Preprocessing Tools

The preprocessing workflow for miniscope imaging includes denoising, motion correction,
cell segmentation, and calcium event extraction (sometimes described as "deconvolution"
or "spike inference"). For the UCLA Miniscopes, the following [analysis
packages](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki/Analysis-Packages) are
commonly used:

- [Miniscope Denoising](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki/Removing-Horizontal-Noise-from-Recordings),
  Daniel Aharoni (UCLA), Python
- [NoRMCorre](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre), Flatiron Institute, MATLAB
- [CNMF-E](https://github.com/zhoupc/CNMF_E), Pengcheng Zhou (Liam Paninski's Lab, Columbia
  University), MATLAB
- [CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), Flatiron Institute, Python
- [miniscoPy](https://github.com/PeyracheLab/miniscoPy), Guillaume Viejo (Adrien Peyrache's
  Lab, McGill University), Python
- [MIN1PIPE](https://github.com/JinghaoLu/MIN1PIPE), Jinghao Lu (Fan Wang's Lab, MIT), MATLAB
- [CIAtah](https://github.com/bahanonu/ciatah), Biafra Ahanonu, MATLAB
- [MiniAn](https://github.com/DeniseCaiLab/minian), Phil Dong (Denise Cai's Lab, Mount Sinai),
  Python
- [MiniscopeAnalysis](https://github.com/etterguillaume/MiniscopeAnalysis), Guillaume Etter
  (Sylvain Williams' Lab, McGill University), MATLAB
- [PIMPN](https://github.com/etterguillaume/PIMPN), Guillaume Etter (Sylvain Williams's Lab,
  McGill University), Python
- [CellReg](https://github.com/zivlab/CellReg), Liron Sheintuch (Yaniv Ziv's Lab, Weizmann
  Institute of Science), MATLAB
- Inscopix Data Processing Software (IDPS)
- Inscopix Multimodal Image Registration and Analysis (MIRA)

Based on interviews with UCLA and Inscopix miniscope users and developers, each research
lab uses a different preprocessing workflow. These custom workflows are often closed
source and not tracked with version control software. For the preprocessing tools that
are open source, they are often developed by an individual during their training period
and lack funding for long term maintenance. These factors result in a lack of
standardization for miniscope preprocessing tools, which is a major obstacle to adoption
for new labs.

## Element Architecture

Each of the DataJoint Elements are a set of tables for common neuroinformatics
modalities to organize, preprocess, and analyze data. Each node in the following diagram
is either a table in the Element itself or a table that would be connected to the
Element.

![element-miniscope diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datajoint/element-miniscope/main/images/attached_miniscope_element.svg)

### `subject` schema ([API docs](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-animal/api/element_animal/subject))

Although not required, most choose to connect the `Session` table to a `Subject` table.

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Subject | Basic information of the research subject. |

### `session` schema ([API docs](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-session/api/element_session/session_with_datetime))

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Session | Unique experimental session identifier. |

### `miniscope` schema ([API docs](../api/element_miniscope/miniscope))

Tables related to importing, analyzing, and exporting miniscope data.

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Recording | A table containing information about the equipment used (e.g. the acquisition hardware information). |
| RecordingInfo |  The metadata about this recording from the Miniscope DAQ software (e.g. frame rate, number of channels, frames, etc.). |
| MotionCorrection | A table with information about motion correction performed on a recording. |
| MotionCorrection.RigidMotionCorrection | A table with details of rigid motion correction (e.g. shifting in x, y). |
| MotionCorrection.NonRigidMotionCorrection and MotionCorrection.Block | These tables describe the non-rigid motion correction. |
| MotionCorrection.Summary | A table containing summary images after motion correction. |
| Segmentation | This table specifies the segmentation step and its outputs, following the motion correction step. |
| Segmentation.Mask | This table contains the image mask for the segmented region of interest. |
| MaskClassification | This table contains information about the classification of `Segmentation.Mask` into a type (e.g. soma, axon, dendrite, artifact, etc.). |
| Fluorescence | This table contains the fluorescence traces extracted from each `Segmentation.Mask`. |
| ActivityExtractionMethod | A table with information about the activity extraction method (e.g. deconvolution) applied on the fluorescence trace. |
| Activity | A table with neuronal activity traces from fluorescence trace (e.g. spikes). |

### `miniscope_report` schema ([API docs](../api/element_miniscope/miniscope_report))

Tables related to summary reports of miniscope data.

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| QualityMetrics | A table containing information about CaImAn estimates. |

The above `QualityMetrics` table includes the following for each component in the CaImAn
analysis:

- `r_values`: Space correlation.
- `snr`: Trace SNR.
- `cnn_preds`: CNN predictions.

## Pipeline Development

With assistance from Dr. Peyman Golshani's Lab (UCLA) we have added support for the UCLA
Miniscope DAQ V3 acquisition tool and MiniscopeAnalysis preprocessing tool in
`element-miniscope` and `workflow-miniscope`. They have provided example data for
development.

Based on interviews, we are considering adding support for the tools listed below. The
deciding factors include the number of users, long term support, quality controls, and
python programming language (so that the preprocessing tool can be triggered within the
element).

- Acquisition tools + Miniscope DAQ V4 + Inscopix Data Acquisition Software (IDAS)
- Preprocessing tools + Inscopix Data Processing Software (IDPS) + Inscopix Multimodal Image
  Registration and Analysis (MIRA) + MiniAn + CaImAn + CNMF-E + CellReg

## Roadmap

Further development of this Element is community driven. Upon user requests and based on
guidance from the Scientific Steering Group we will add features to this Element, such
as:

- Acquisition & Preprocessing tools
- Inscopix
  - Data Acquisition Software (IDAS)
  - Data Processing Software (IDPS)
