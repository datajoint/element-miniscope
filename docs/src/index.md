# Element Miniscope Calcium Imaging

DataJoint Element for functional calcium imaging data acquired with the [UCLA Miniscope](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4)
and [Miniscope DAQ](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software)
acquisition system, and
analyzed with `CaImAn`. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate data
collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular
pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be
combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.
