# Tutorials

## Installation

Installation of the Element requires an integrated development environment and database. Instructions to setup each of the components can be found on the [User Instructions](datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-instructions) page. These instructions use the example [workflow for Element Miniscope](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope), which can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements.

## YouTube

Our [Element Miniscope tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWUcPFZOSVw) gives an overview of the workflow directory as well as core concepts related to Miniscope itself.

## Notebooks

Each of the [notebooks](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope/tree/main/notebooks) in the workflow steps through ways to interact with the Element itself. To try out Elements notebooks in an online Jupyter environment with access to example data, visit [CodeBook](https://codebook.datajoint.io/). (Miniscope notebooks coming soon!)

- [00-DataDownload](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope/blob/main/notebooks/00-DataDownload_Optional.ipynb) highlights how to use DataJoint tools to download a sample model for trying out the Element.
