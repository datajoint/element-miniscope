# Tutorials

+ DataJoint Elements are modular pipelines that can be connected into a complete workflow.  [Workflow Miniscope](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope) is an example that combines five DataJoint Elements - Lab, Animal, Session, Event, and Miniscope.

+ Workflow Miniscope includes an [interactive tutorial on GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-miniscope#interactive-tutorial), which is configured for users to run the pipeline.

+ In the interactive tutorial, the example notebooks describe the pipeline and provide instructions for running the pipeline.  For convenience, these notebooks are also rendered on this website:
   + [Tutorial notebook](./tutorial.ipynb)
   + [Quality metrics notebook](./quality_metrics.ipynb)

## Installation Instructions for Active Projects

+ The Workflow Miniscope described above can be modified for a user's specific experimental requirements and thereby used in active projects.  

+ The GitHub Codespace and Dev Container is configured for tutorials and prototyping.  
We recommend users to configure a database specifically for production pipelines.  Instructions for a local installation of the integrated development environment with a database can be found on the [User Guide](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page.

+ The [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWUcPFZOSVw) gives an overview 
of the workflow files and notebooks, as well as core concepts related to calcium imaging
analysis.
